.SH NAME
memprobe \- ROOT utility to examine memory usage
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B memprobe
.I "[options]"
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
To activate the memory checker you have to set in the \fB.rootrc\fR
file the resource \fBRoot.MemCheck\fR to 1 (e.g.: \fBRoot.MemCheck:
1\fR) and you  have to link with \fBlibNew.so\fR (e.g. use
\fBroot-config --new --libs\fR) or use \fBrootn.exe\fR. 
.PP
When all this is the case you will find at the end of the program
execution a file \fBmemcheck.out\fR in the directory where you started
your ROOT program. Alternatively you can set the resource
\fBRoot.MemCheckFile\fR to the name of a file to which the leak
information will be written. The contents of this \fBmemcheck.out\fR
file can be analyzed and transformed into printable  text via the
\fBmemprobe\fR program (in \fB/usr/bin\fR).
