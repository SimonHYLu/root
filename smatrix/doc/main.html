\mainpage SMatrix Package


@b SMatrix is a C++ package for high performance vector and matrix
  computations. It can be used only in problems when the size of the matrices is known 
at compile time, like in the tracking reconstruction of HEP experiments. It is based on a C++ technique, called expression templates, to achieve an high level optimization. The C++ templates can be used to implement vector and matrix
expressions such that these expressions can be transformed at compile time to
code which is equivalent to hand optimized code in a low-level language like FORTRAN
or C (see for example ref. 1) 
<p>
The SMatrix has been deeveloped initially by T. Glebe of the  Max-Planck-Institut, Heidelberg, as part of the HeraB analysis framework. A subset of the original package has been now incorporated in the %ROOT distribution, with the aim to provide to the LHC experiments a stand-alone and high performant matrix package for reconstruction. The API of the current package differs from the original one, in order to be complient to the %ROOT coding conventions.
