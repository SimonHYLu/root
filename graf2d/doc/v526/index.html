<h3>Graphical Output</h3>

<h4>PostScript and PDF</h4>
<ul>
<li> In the following macro the minus sign was not correct:
   <pre>
   {
      TCanvas *c = new TCanvas;
      TLatex *l = new TLatex(0.5, 0.5, "#font[122]{a = b + c - d #pm e}");
      l->Draw();
      c->SaveAs("c.eps");
    }
    </pre>
    The font 122 is the greek one. With a such TLatex "a" becomes "alpha", 
    "b" becomes " beta" etc ... It is not the recommended way to do greek
    characters with TLatex, but it should work anyway.
</ul>


<h3>Graphics Primitives</h3>

<h4>TLatex</h4>
<ul>
<li> In the following macro the <tt>#int</tt> and <tt>#sum</tt> symbols had 
     wrong limits placement if the character just before started with "#".
   <pre>
   {
      TCanvas *c1 = new TCanvas("c1","c1",500,500);
      TLatex l;
      l.SetTextSize(0.1);

      l.DrawLatex(0.1,0.6,"#nu#int^{1-x}_{2#pi}");
      l.DrawLatex(0.1,0.2,"a#int^{1-x}_{2#pi}");

      l.DrawLatex(0.5,0.6,"#nu#sum^{1-x}_{2#pi}");
      l.DrawLatex(0.5,0.2,"a#sum^{1-x}_{2#pi}");
   }
   </pre>

   This problem is there since the 1st version of TLatex. It is fixed by:
   <ol>
   <li>Giving "^" and "_" a lower precedence than special and greek characters.
   <li>Making a special case for #int and #sum and giving them even
      lower precedence than "^" and "_". 
   </ol>

   issue.
