<h3>Math Libraries</h3>

<h4>TMath</h4>
<ul>
<li>Add 2 new functions to compare floating points:
<pre>
Bool_t AreEqualAbs(Double_t af, Double_t bf, Double_t epsilon) {
//return kTRUE if absolute difference between af and bf is less than epsilon
Bool_t AreEqualRel(Double_t af, Double_t bf, Double_t relPrec) {
//return kTRUE if relative difference between af and bf is less than relPrec
</pre>
</ul>

<h4>TMatrix</h4>

 Various changes to the  Sparse Matrix  classes:
  <ul>
    <li>Fixed Savannah bugs 45807,45502 and 45415
    <li>added a Streamer function to TMatrixTSparse to remove a memory
    leak.
    <li>Added vector functionality as proposed by Peter D Barnes from LNL
  (<a><href="http://root.cern.ch/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=8351">http://root.cern.ch/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=8351</a>).
    <pre>
double   s = v1 * M * v2;  // Mult Function : e.g., physics matrix element 
TMatrixD M = v1' * v2      // outer product of v1 and v2
 </pre>
  </ul>

<h4>SMatrix</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Use specialized structures for building automatically static
  tables for the indeces map of the symmetric matrices. This gives an
  improvements of around 10-20% in testKalman and in the matrix
  operations test.
</ul>

<h4>Minuit</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Implement in the TMinuitMinimizer class the method SetPrecision() using the "SET EPS" Minuit command
  <li>Fix a problem when using the user provided gradient in TMinuitMinimizer. The gradient calculation is always forced.
  <li>Implement in TMinuitMinimizer method to retrieve the variable name given the index
  <li>Fix a printout in TMinuit::mnscan and a problem observed with valgrind>
 </ul>

<h4>Minuit2</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Fix a bug in MnFunctionCross. 
    <li>Add a protection against very small step sizes which can cause
  <em>nan</em> values in  InitialGradientCalculator.
    <li> Implement a new function in MnUserTransformation.h, FindIndex(name)  which retunrs -1 when the parameter name does not exist.
    <li> Implement new methods in Minuit2Minimizer as requested by the Minimizer interface:
    SetPrecision(eps), which changes the value in MnPrecision,  VariableName(index) to return the name of a varaible (parameter) given an index and VariableIndex(name) to return the index of a variable given a name.  
<li> Set a  status code in Minuit2Minimizer according to the following convention: status = minimizeStatus + 10 * minosStatus + 100 * hesseStatus. See the Minuit2Minimizer reference documentation for the possible values of minimizeStatus , minosStatus and hesseStatus. 
    <li> In MnHesse when inversion failed return MnInvertFailed instead of MnHesseFailed
</ul>

<h4>Mathcore Fitting classes</h4>
<ul>
<li>Fix the fitting with the integral option in multi-dimensions. 
<li>Force the gradient calculation when requested in the minimizer
  classes and avoid to perform the check when using TMinuit. This was
  already the case in Minuit2.
<li>Add new class <tt>ROOT::Fit::SparseData</tt> for dealing with binned sparse data. This class automatically merges the empty region, so they can be considered,  whenever possible as a larger single bin. This imporves the performances when performing likelihood fits on the sparse data
</li>
<li>Fix the likelihood fits for variable bin histograms. Now a correct normalization is applied according to the bin volume.
<li>Add new methods in Minimizer class :
<ul>
<li><tt>Minimizer::SetPrecision(double eps)</tt>  to change in the minimizer the precision on which the objective functions are evaluated. By default the numerical double precision is used inside the minimizers. This method should be used only if the precision in the function evaluation is worse than the double precision. 
  <li><tt>std::string Minimizer::VariableName (unsigned int index)</tt> to return a name of the minimizer  variable (i.e. a fitting parameter) given the integer index. Return an empty string if the variable is not found or of the minimizer does not re-implement this method. 
  <li><tt>int Minimizer::VariableIndex(const std::string & name)</tt> to return the index of a variable given a name. Return -1 if the variable is not found or if the specific minimizer does not re-implement this function.  
  </ul>

  <li><tt>ROOT::Fit::FitResult</tt>: fix a problem in the I/O, the function pointer is made temporary and cannot be saved. Change also the Print() method to print now the results also when the fit is invalid (i.e. did not converge correctly).
  
  </ul>
