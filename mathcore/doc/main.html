\mainpage MathCore library 


@b MathCore provides a collection of functions and C++ classes for HEP numerical computing. This library provides only  the basic mathem
atical functions and algorithms and not all the functionality required by the HEP community. 
The current set includes classes and functions for:   
<ul>
<li>Basic special functions used in HEP like Gamma, Error functions,    
<li>Mathematical functions used in statistics such as  probability density functions, cumulative distributions functions and their inver
se.
<li>\ref Vector

</ul>



The current version can be downloaded <A HREF="http://seal.web.cern.ch/seal/MathLibs/MathCore-5_0_6.tar.gz">here</A>. 
To build the library run first the <em>configure</em> script and then <em>make</em>. Do <em>configure --help</em> to see options available in configuring, like defining the installation directory. Run also <em>make install</em> to install the library and include files and <em>make check</em> to build the tests.  
<br>
The library built in this way, in contrast to the one distributed by %ROOT,  does not contain the dictionary information and therefore cannot be used interactivly.
