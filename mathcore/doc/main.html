\mainpage MathCore library 


@b MathCore provides a collection of functions and C++ classes for HEP numerical computing. This library provides only  the basic mathem
atical functions and algorithms and not all the functionality required by the HEP community. 
The current set includes classes and functions for:   
<ul>
<li>\ref SpecFunc "Basic special functions" used in HEP like the gamma, beta and error function;    
<li> \ref StatFunc : mathematical functions used in statistics, such as the probability density functions and the cumulative distributions functions (lower and upper integral of the pdf's);
se.
<li>\ref Vector "GenVector": physics and geometry vectors for 3 and 4 dimensions with their transformations (rotations and boost). 

</ul>


The current version can be downloaded <A HREF="http://seal.web.cern.ch/seal/MathLibs/5_0_8/MathCore-5.08.00.tar.gz">here</A>. 
To build the library run first the <em>configure</em> script and then <em>make</em>. Do <em>configure --help</em> to see options available in configuring, like defining the installation directory. Run also <em>make install</em> to install the library and include files and <em>make check</em> to build the tests.  
<br>
The library built in this way, in contrast to the one distributed by %ROOT,  does not contain the dictionary information and therefore cannot be used interactivly.
