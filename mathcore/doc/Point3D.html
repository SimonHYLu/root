  \page Point3DPage  Point3D Classes


The following types of Point are defined by defaults: 

<ul>
<li>ROOT::Math::XYZPoint  point based on x,y,z coordinates (cartesian) in double precision
<li>ROOT::Math::XYZPointF  point based on x,y,z coordinates (cartesian) in float precision
<li>ROOT::Math::Polar3DPoint point based on r,theta,phi coordinates (polar) in double precision
<li>ROOT::Math::Polar3DPointF point based on r,theta,phi coordinates (polar) in float precision
<li>ROOT::Math::RhoEtaPhiPoint point based on rho,eta,phi coordinates (cylindrical using eta instead of z) in double precision
<li>ROOT::Math::RhoEtaPhiPointF point based on rho,eta,phi coordinates (cylindrical using eta instead of z) in float precision
</ul>

<h4>Constructors and Assignment</h4>
The following declarations are available: 
<pre>
 XYZPoint         p1;                     // create an empty vector (x = 0, y = 0, z = 0) 
 XYZPoint         p2( 1,2,3);             // create a vector with x=1, y = 2, z = 3; 
 Polar3DPoint     p3( 1, PI/2, PI);       // create a vector with r = 1, theta = PI/2 and phi=PI
 RhoEtaPHiPoint   p4( 1, 2, PI)           // create a vector with rho= 1, eta = 2, phi = PI
</pre>
Note that each type of vector is constructed by passing its coordinates representations, so a XYZPoint(1,2,3) is different from a 
Polar3DPoint(1,2,3). 
<p>
In addition the Point classes can be constructed by any vector, which implements the accessors x(), y() and z().   
This con be another Point3D based on a different coordinate system types or even any vector of a different package, like the CLHEP HepThreePoint that implements the required signatures.  
<pre>
  XYZPoint             p1(1,2,3); 
  RhoEtaPHiPoint       r2(v1); 
  CLHEP::HepThreePoint q(1,2,3); 
  XYZPoint             p3(q)  
</pre>

<h4>Coordinate Accessors and Setter Methods</h4>
For the Points classes we have the same methods as for the Vector classes. 
See the example for the \ref Vector3DPage.

<h4>Arithmetic Operations</h4>
The following operations are possible between Point3D and Vector3D classes: 
( p is a one of the Point3D class, v is a Vector3D class ) 
<pre>
p += v; 
p -= v;   
</pre>
In addition between Point 3D classes, the following operations are possibles returning Points or Vectors 
( points and vectors can be in different coordinate system but the returned type,  p3 (v3) is the same type of p1 (v1) )   
<pre>
p3 = p1 + v2;   
p3 = v1 + p2;  
p3 = p1 - v2;   
p3 = v1 - p2;      
v3 = p1 - p2;    // difference between points returns a vector 
</pre>
Note that additions between two points is NOT possible and the difference between points returns a vector.
