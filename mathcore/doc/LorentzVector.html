  \page LorentzVectorPage  LorentzVector Classes


To avoid exposing templated parameter to the users, typedefs are defined for all types of  vectors based an double's and float's. To use them, one must include the header file <em>Math/Vector4D.h</em>.
The following typedef's, defined in the header file <em>Math/Vector4Dfwd.h</em>, are available for the different instantiations of the template class ROOT::Math::LorentzVector:    

<ul>
<li>ROOT::Math::XYZTVector  vector based on x,y,z,t coordinates (cartesian) in double precision
<li>ROOT::Math::XYZTVectorF  vector based on x,y,z,t coordinates (cartesian) in float precision
<li>ROOT::Math::PtEtaPhiEVector vector based on pt (rho),eta,phi and E (t) coordinates  in double precision
<li>ROOT::Math::PtEtaPhiEVector vector based on pt (rho),eta,phi and E (t) coordinates  in double precision
<li>ROOT::Math::PxPyPzMVector vector based on px,py,pz and M (mass) coordinates  in double precision
</ul>
The metric used for all the LorentzVector's is (-,-,-,+)

<h4>Constructors and Assignment</h4>
The following declarations are available: 
<pre>
 XYZTVector           v1;                  // create an empty vector (x = 0, y = 0, z = 0, t = 0) 
 XYZTVector           v2(1,2,3,4);         // create a vector with x=1, y = 2, z = 3, t = 4 
 PtEtaPhiEVector  v3( 1, 2, PI, 5);        // create a vector with pt = 1, eta = 2, phi = PI, E = 5
</pre>
Note that each type of vector is constructed by passing its coordinates representations, so a XYZTVector(1,2,3,4) is different from a PtEtaPhiEVector(1,2,3,4). 
<p>
In addition the Vector classes can be constructed by any vector, which implements the accessors x(), y() and z() and t(). 
This con be another LorentzVector3 based on a different coordinate system or even any vector of a different package, like the CLHEP HepLorentzVector that implements the required signatures.  
<pre>
  XYZTVector           v1(1,2,3,4); 
  PtEtaPhiEVector      v2(v1);
 
  CLHEP::HepLorentzVector q(1,2,3,4); 
  XYZTVector              v3(q)  
</pre>

<h4>Coordinate Accessors</h4>
To get information on the coordinates on the vector (cartesian, polar, cylindrical, etc...) see the documentation for the class ROOT::Math::LorentzVector

<h4>Setter Methods</h4>
Setter methods as in CLHEP, setting each coordinate at a time are not supported. The setters methods supported are : 
<ul>
<li> SetCoordinates(c1,c2,c3,c4)  which sets the four basic coordinates, x,y,z,t for a ROOT::Math::XYZTVector and pt, eta, phi, E for a ROOT::Math::PtEtaPhiEVector
<li>SetXYZT(x,y,z,t) which set the x,y,z,t for all type of vectors.
</ul>
In additions are supported as for the 3D Vectors the Set/GetCoordinates from C arrays or using iterators

<h4>Arithmetic Operations</h4>
The following operations are possible between LorentzVectors classes, even of different coordinate system types: 
( v is a one of the LorentzVector class, q is a generic Vector  implementing x(), y(), z() and t() and a  is 
a generic scalar type: double, flot, int, etc.... )  
<pre>
v += q; 
v -= q; 
v1 *= a;
v1 /= a; 
</pre>
Between LorentzVector classes, the following operations are possibles: ( v1 and v2 can be two vectors in different coordinate system. v3 is the same type of v1)   
<pre>
v3 = v1 + v2;   
v3 = v1 - v2;  
v2 = a * v1;   
v2 = v1 * a;
v2 = v1 / a;   
</pre>
