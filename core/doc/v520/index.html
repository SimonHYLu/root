<h3>Core</h3>
<ul>
<li>
Class TMessageHandler derives now from TQObject and does emit signals.
This allows for easier usage of this class.
</li>
<li>
In this release xrootd and libAfterImage are managed in Subversion
via so called "vendor branches". This is completely transparent
except for people who do directly use svn. You will get the message:
<pre>
   $ svn up
   svn: Failed to add directory 'xrootd/src/xrootd': object of the same name already exists
   $ rm -rf xrootd/src/xrootd
   $ svn up
   svn: Failed to add directory 'asimage/src/libAfterImage': object of the same name already exists
   $ rm -rf asimage/src/libAfterImage
   $ svn up
</pre>
</li>
<li>
Port to gcc 4.3.0 This version of gcc is much stricker with respect to
implicit header files so in many source files <stdlib.h> and <string.h>
had to be added.
</li>
<li>
TPRegexp
<ul>
<li>
Modularized Match() and Substitute() functions so that the low-level work
is done by MatchInternal() and SubstituteInternal().
</li>
<li>
Added function TString GetModifiers() that translates from bit-flag
options back to perl-style option characters.
</li>
<li>
For all functions that do actual matching replaced the default value
of 'Int_t nMatchMax' argument from 30 to 10. PCRE internals require
the index buffer to be 3-times the number of allowed matches. This
multiplication is now performed in individual functions and nMatchMax
is really the number of allowed matches. Two function calls in 
TString passing this number explicitly have been updated.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
TPMERegexp
<ul>
<li>
New sub-class of TPRegexp with API closer to PERL.
Supports main Perl operations using regular expressions (Match,
Substitute and Split). To retrieve the results one can simply use
operator[] returning a TString.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
New tutorial regexp_pme.C.
