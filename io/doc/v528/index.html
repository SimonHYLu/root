<h4>TFile::MakeProject</h4>
Extend TFile::MakeProject to support genreflex, cases of user's data model where
the 2 distincts pointers point to a single object and more cases where we are 
missing the StreamerInfo and need to guess whether the symbol represent an enum,
a class or a namespace.

To use genreflex, call MakeProject with the "genreflex" option, for example:
<pre style="border:gray 1px solid;padding:0.5em 2em;background:#ffe">
   file->MakeProject(libdir,"*","NEW+genreflex");
</pre>
To make sure the library created by MakeProject does not double delete an object,
tell the StreamerElement representing one of the pointers pointing to the object
to never delete the object.  For example:

<pre style="border:gray 1px solid;padding:0.5em 2em;background:#ffe">
   TVirtualStreamerInfo *info = (TVirtualStreamerInfo*)file->GetStreamerInfoCache()->FindObject("HepMC::GenVertex");
   if (info) {
      TObject *el = info->GetElements()->FindObject("m_event");
      if (el) el->SetBit(TStreamerElement::kDoNotDelete);
   }
</pre>
Note that MakeProject only uses the list of StreamerInfo internal to the TFile (as opposed
to the global list of StreamerInfo used by the regular I/O operations) and thus the change
must be done on the StreamerInfo in file->GetStreamerInfoCache().

MakeProject now implements a move constructor for each classes.   For the implementation, we 'use' the 'copy constructor' until the C++ compilers properly support the official move constructor notation.   Implementing a move constructor avoid having to delete and reconstruct resource during a std::vector resize and avoid the double delete induced by using the default copy constructor.

<h4>Misc.</h4>
<ul><li>To make sure that the class emulation layer of ROOT does not double delete an object,
tell the StreamerElement representing one of the pointers pointing to the object
to never delete the object.  For example:

<pre style="border:gray 1px solid;padding:0.5em 2em;background:#ffe">
   TClass *clGenVertex = TClass::GetClass("HepMC::GenVertex");
   if (clGenVertex) {
      TObject *el = clGenVertex->GetStreamerInfo()->GetElements()->FindObject("m_event");
      if (el) el->SetBit(TStreamerElement::kDoNotDelete);
   }
</pre>
</li>
