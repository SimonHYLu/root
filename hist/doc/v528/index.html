<h4>TGraphDelaunay</h4>
<ul>
<li> New version of the method <tt>TGraphDelaunay::Enclose()</tt>. This method
     decides if a point is inside a triangle or not. The way it was implemented
     produced infinite numbers and generated wrong peaks. It was visible on some
     machines only (for instance MacOsX). Now this method uses 
     <tt>TMath::IsInside()</tt>. It is much safer, it runs faster, and the
     code is simpler. The problem could be seen with a simple macro like the
     following one:
     <pre>
     {
        TCanvas *c1 = new TCanvas("c1", "c1",0,0,600,600);
        c1->SetTheta(90.);
        c1->SetPhi(0.0001);
        gStyle->SetPalette(1);
        TGraph2D *graph2d = new TGraph2D();
        graph2d->SetPoint(0, 110, 110, 0.0);
        graph2d->SetPoint(1, -80,  50, 1.0);
        graph2d->SetPoint(2, -70,  40, 2.0);
        graph2d->SetPoint(3,-110, -50, 3.0);
        graph2d->SetNpx(9);
        graph2d->SetNpy(9);
        graph2d->Draw("surf1");
        graph2d->SetLineWidth(2);
        graph2d->Draw(" triw p0 same");
     }
     </pre>
</ul>

<h4>THistPainter</h4>
<ul>
<li> After executing the following macro, zooming the X axis interactively
     generated the error message:
     <br>
     <tt>Error in <TGraphPainter::PaintGraphHist>: X must have N+1 values with option N </tt>
     <pre>
     {
        int n = 70;
        TH1F h("h","test",n,0.,30.);
        TRandom3 rndm_engine;
        for (int i=0; i<10000; ++i) h->Fill(rndm_engine->Gaus(15.,4.));
        TF1 f("f","gaus");
        h->Fit("f");
        gPad->SetLogx();
     }
     </pre>
</ul>


<h4>TGraph</h4>
<ul>
<li>Fix a bug in TGraph::Eval when evaluating at the graph point
  values. </li>
</ul>
