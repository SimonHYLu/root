<h3>hist: Histogram classes</h3>

  The hist library now depends on <em>libMathCore</em> which must be linked whenever one needs to use the histogram library.
<br>

<h4>TF1</h4>
  The major changes done in the TF1 class are:
<ul>
  <li>
  The code used for implementing methods like <tt>TF1::Integration</tt> or <tt>TF1::Derivation</tt> or <tt>TF1::GetX</tt> has now been moved in MathCore, but it remains the same.
  <li>A new method <tt>TF1::operator()(double x, double y=0, double z)</tt> which is equivalent to <tt>TF1::Eval</tt> has been added for using TF1 as a callable object.
  </li>
</ul>


<h4>TH1</h4>

Fixed a bug in the Th1::KolmogorovTest function in the cse of scaled or weighted  histograms. The routine has been improved and 
now could also be used for comparing an histogram with a function if it is represented as an histogram with zero errors (equivalent to the case of options "F1" or "F2" in the original HDIFF routine of HBOOK).



<h4>THnSparse</h4>
<ul>
<li>Implement THnSparse::Projection and THnSparse::Merge

</ul>
