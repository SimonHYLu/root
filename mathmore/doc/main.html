/**  \mainpage MathMore library

@b MathMore provides an advanced  collection of functions and C++ classes for HEP numerical computing. This is an extension of the functionality provided by the <A HREF="../../MathCore/html/">MathCore</A> library. 
The current set includes classes and functions for:   
<ul>
<li>Special functions, with all the major functions used in HEP (Bessel, Gamma, Error functions, etc..)   
<li>Mathematical functions used in statistics such as  probability density functions, cumulative distributions functions and their inverse.
<li>Numerical algorithms  for one dimensional functions : 
<ul>
<li>Numerical integration
<li>Numerical differentiation 
<li>Root finder
<li>Minimization 
</ul>
<li>Interpolation 
<li>Function approximation based on Chebyshev polynomials
<li>Polynomial evaluation and root solvers

</ul>
In addition the package includes the interfaces for generic (ROOT::Math::IGenFunction) and parameteric (ROOT::Math::IParamFunction) one-dimensional functions. 
<p>
The mathematical functions are implemented as a set of free functions in the namespace \em ROOT::Math. The naming used for the special functions is the same proposed for the C++ standard (see C++ standard extension <A HREF="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2004/n1687.pdf"> proposal document</A>).

The MathCore library is implemented wrapping in C++ the GNU Scientific Library (<A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl">GSL</A>). The needed routine of GSL are compiled in the library in the %ROOT version, while in the standalone version GSL is needed to both build and use libMathMore. 
<A HREF="http://seal.web.cern.ch/seal/MathLibs/gsl-1.5.tar.gz">Here</A> you can find a tar file of GSL compatible with MathMore, it is the one used for building MathMore for the ROOT distribution. 

The current version can be downloaded <A HREF="../MathMore.tar.gz">here</A>. 
To build the library run first the script <em>configure --with-gsl="gsl_dir_location"</em> and then <em>make</em>. Do <em>configure --help</em> to see options available in configuring, like defining the installation directory. Run also <em>make install</em> to install the library and include files and <em>make check</em> to build the tests.  
<br>
The library built in this way, in contrast to the one distributed by %ROOT,  does not contain the dictionary information and therefore cannot be used interactivly.
