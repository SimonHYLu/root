/**  \mainpage MathMore library

@b MathMore provides an advanced  collection of functions and C++ classes for HEP numerical computing. This is an extension of the functionality provided by the <A HREF="../../MathCore/html/">MathCore</A> library. 
The current set includes classes and functions for:   
<ul>
<li>\ref SpecFunc, with all the major functions used in HEP (Bessel, Gamma, Error functions, etc..)   
<li>\ref StatFunc, Mathematical functions used in statistics such as  probability density functions, cumulative distributions functions and their inverse.
<li>Numerical algorithms  for one dimensional functions : 
<ul>
<li>\ref Integration
<li>\ref Deriv
<li>\ref RootFinders
<li>\ref Minimization
</ul>
<li>\ref Interpolation 
<li>\ref FuncApprox, based on Chebyshev polynomials
<li>\ref Random
<li>\ref CppFunctions : 
<ul>
<li>interfaces for generic (ROOT::Math::IGenFunction) and parameteric (ROOT::Math::IParamFunction) one-dimensional functions</li>
<li>Concrete function classes like ROOT::Math::Polynomial for polynomial evaluation and root solvers 
</ul>
<p>
The mathematical functions are implemented as a set of free functions in the namespace \em ROOT::Math. The naming used for the special functions is the same proposed for the C++ standard (see C++ standard extension <A HREF="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2004/n1687.pdf"> proposal document</A>).

The MathMore library is implemented wrapping in C++ the GNU Scientific Library (<A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl">GSL</A>). To build MathMore you need to have first GSL installed somewhere in your system. A version of GSL larger or equal 1.5 is required. A tar file of GSL can be downloaded from the <A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/#downloading">GSL Web site</A>, or (for version 1.8) from 
<A HREF="http://seal.web.cern.ch/seal/MathLibs/gsl-1.8.tar.gz">here</A>. Windows binaries, compiled using Visual Studio 7.1 can be downloaded from  <A HREF="http://seal.web.cern.ch/seal/MathLibs/GSL-1.8.zip">this location</A>.

The current version of MathMore can be downloaded <A HREF="../MathMore.tar.gz">here</A>. 
To build the library run first the script <em>configure --with-gsl="gsl_dir_location"</em> and then <em>make</em>. Do <em>configure --help</em> to see options available in configuring, like defining the installation directory. Run also <em>make install</em> to install the library and include files and <em>make check</em> to build the tests.  
<br>
The library built in this way, in contrast to the one distributed by %ROOT,  does not contain the dictionary information and therefore cannot be used interactivly.
