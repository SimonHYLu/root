The compression package "zlib" is part of the zip directory. The original tar 
file can be downloaded from : http://www.zlib.org 

Only the useful code has been extracted from this tar file. It consists of: 

 zip/inc:
   crc32.h deflate.h inffast.h inffixed.h inflate.h
   inftrees.h trees.h zconf.h zlib.h zutil.h

 zip/src:
   adler32.c compress.c crc32.c deflate.c gzio.c infback.c
   inffast.c inflate.c inftrees.c trees.c uncompr.c zutil.c

To put a new zlib version in ROOT, all these files must be replaced.

The zlib version number can be found in zip/inc/zlib.h

zlib is now used in TPDF to compress the "stream" part of PDF files.

The ROOT compress functions R__zip and R__unzip have also been modified
in order to use zlib. Some performance tests (on a P4 2.4GHz) show that 
the new zlib version is as fast as the current ROOT zip functions when
writing and up to 10 per cent faster when reading.

To activate the new zlib it is enough to set Root.ZipMode = 1
in the system.rootrc file.
When setting Root.ZipMode to 1 (or 0) it is possible to read files
written with the old zip function.
Files written with Root.ZipMode=1 can only be read by versions
of Root >= 4.02/00
